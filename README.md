Security based android application which uses its own API with firebase database

Idea :
Android App which helps users to prevent road accidents and to save life in case any occur.
We are gonna prepare a dataset of all the dangers i.e accident prone locations based on Delhi Traffic Police Report 2019. So when a person begins driving or walking he just clicks the "start" button in
the app, it starts working and the app continuously matches the person's location with the
"accident prone locations in the database".
If any of the prone locations comes within the "range of 50 metres" of that person. A
"pop-based warning"will be generated by the app that you will be entering into an accident
prone area and all the history about that area present in the database will be played as a
warning. It will help them to prevent accidents.
